# try_sympy_mechanics
dynamic analysis with sympy/mechanics - example problems
The intention of this repository is to provide some example problems solved with sympy/mechanics applying either Kanes Method or Lagrange Method. The example problems should help to get a better insight using this package for those who are unfamiliar with it.
Primarily, the problems are solved by deriving the equation(s) of motion symbollically. However, some problems may be solved numerically afterweards as well usinng scipy, numpy and/or mathplotlib.
The source code is provided either as a pure python file or as a Jupiter Notebook (with some additional explanations).
Some problems are explained in more detail on https://alban223124818.wordpress.com/. However, most of it is currently in German.
