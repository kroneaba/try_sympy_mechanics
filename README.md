# try_sympy_mechanics
dynamic analysis with sympy/mechanics - example problems
The intention of this repository is to provide some example problems solved with sympy/mechanics allying either Kanes Method or Lagrange Method. The example problems should help to get a better insight applying this package.
Primarily, the problems are solved by deriving the equation(s) of motion symbollically. However, some problems may be solved numerically afterweards usinng scipy, numpy and/or mathplotlib.
The source code is provided either as pure python file or as a Jupiter Notebook (with some additional explanations).
Some problems are explained in more detail on https://alban223124818.wordpress.com/. However, most of it is currently in German.
